Overview
========

Plow is a command-line music library and playlist creation tool.

How to compile and install
==========================

Requirements:
  * sqlite3 libs (best is >= 3.3)
  * taglib (>= 1.4)

Download source code, then:
  $ tar zxvf plow-x.y.z.tar.gz
  $ cd plow-x.y.z
  $ make
  (and as root):
  $ make install

Notes:
  * If you want to optimize your build of plow use
    CXXFLAGS, e.g.
      $ CXXFLAGS="-O2 -march=pentium4" make
  * If you want to install plow into another directory
    than /usr/local/ change PREFIX in Makefile.


Setting up and using plow
=========================

If you use plow for the first time, plow creates
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/triiuark/plow.conf and
$XDG_DATA_HOME/triiuark/plow.sqlite.

Notes:
  * If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is empty then ~/.config is used.
  * If $XDG_DATA_HOME is empty then ~/.local/share is used.

Then edit $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/triiuark/plow.conf and change at least
path and player0 settings under [general] section. If you use Ogg/Vorbis files
it is recommanded to change also the field names under [vorbis] section.

Run:
  $ plow --insert /path/to/music
to fill the database. This may take a long time.

Thats it now you can try:
  $ plow --help
or just create a playlist containing all files
  $ plow


Documentation
=============

You can run
  $ plow --help
or take a look at the man page:
  $ man ./plow.1
or
  $ man plow
if you already installed plow.
